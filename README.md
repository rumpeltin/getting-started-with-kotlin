# Getting Started With Kotlin

A collection of resources to learn the programming language Kotlin.

## Introduction

Kotlin is a modern, trending programming language that was released in 2016 by JetBrains.

It has become very popular since it is compatible with Java (one of the most popular programming languages out there), which means that Java code (and libraries) can be used in Kotlin programs.

Kotlin is used for:

+ Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
+ Web development
+ Server side applications
+ Data science

Why choose Kotlin?

+ Kotlin is fully compatible with Java
+ Kotlin works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
+ Kotlin is concise and safe
+ Kotlin is easy to learn, especially if you already know Java
+ Kotlin is free to use
+ Big community/support

## Getting Started

It is recommended to use the [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with Kotlin.
IntelliJ has been developed by the same people as Kotlin.

For your project, you'll also need to install a [JDK](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3296360/what-is-the-jdk-introduction-to-the-java-development-kit.html) (Java Development Kit), which you can do via the IntelliJ IDE.

The syntax for the iconic "Hello, World!" programme is as follows.

```
fun main() {
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Give it a try!
